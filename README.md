PROJECT INTRODUCTION

This project is the official website for a podcast supporting adult content creators navigating the complex and rapidly evolving world of digital content creation. More than just a place to host episodes, the site functions as a central hub for education, peer support, and industry transparency.

The platform aims to shed light on key topics often left in the dark — from content ownership and copyright protection to legal risks, platform policies, and the rise of AI in content creation. Through in-depth conversations with creators, legal experts, and digital strategists, the podcast offers valuable insight into building a secure, profitable, and sustainable creator business.

The site is designed to support:
- Listeners looking for real-world advice on monetization, protection, and growth
- Peers seeking a trusted community to share tools, experiences, and opportunities
- Sponsors exploring targeted, high-impact audience placements
- Guest speakers with valuable stories or expertise to contribute

Although the project is still in its early stages, the long-term goal is to grow both the podcast and the community — helping creators take ownership of their work, protect their rights, and scale their digital presence with confidence.

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** 
- **[Typography](#typography)** 

### Colour Scheme

I used [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to generate my color palette.

The visual identity of this project is intentionally soft yet bold — designed to resonate 
with the podcast’s audience: independent, creative, and ambitious content creators navigating 
a vulnerable and fast-moving industry.

| Colour | Hex | Meaning & Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Plum | #5A3C5A | A strong, grounding base color. Symbolizes authority, depth, and sophistication — ideal for establishing credibility and seriousness in sensitive topics like legal protection and monetization. |
| Muted Rose | #B4727F | Warm and approachable. This color conveys compassion and vulnerability, reflecting the podcast’s mission to build trust and create a safe space for real conversations. |
| Lavender Mist | #E1B8E7 | Light and imaginative. It nods to creativity, femininity, and innovation — aligning with the podcast’s focus on new tools, platforms, and AI-driven workflows. |
| Soft Blush | #EAD6D3 | Clean and minimal. Used for balance, space, and background elements to keep the interface light and readable while reinforcing a sense of calm and care.

Together, these colors evoke a feminine but powerful energy — blending emotional intelligence with digital confidence. They were chosen not only for visual harmony but to represent the heart of the podcast: unfiltered truth, bold growth, and unapologetic ownership in a space that often lacks transparency.
